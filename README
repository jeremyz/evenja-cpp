First read the famous 'INSTALL' file
or directly as usual :

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you have some errors, use the tools
	delall		 Delete all files build buy autoconf, automake, configure, make, etc.. processes
	del4push	 Delete all files not needed in the git push
	makeconf	 Build the configure and files with autoconf, automake, aclocal, autoheader

The 'ezlog.xml' is an empty XML... no application.
